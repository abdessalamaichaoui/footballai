## üëã Welcome!

Football is all about precision‚Äîevery second and every movement counts. This project is my way of exploring how AI and computer vision can help analyze football in new and exciting ways. Here, you'll find tools for tasks like tracking players, detecting jerseys, and calibrating camera views to get better insights from football footage.

## üèÜ Challenges

I'm working on solving some key challenges in football analytics using AI and computer vision:

- **Ball tracking:** Keeping up with a fast-moving ball is tough, especially in high-speed footage.
- **Reading jersey numbers:** Numbers can be hard to read due to motion blur, angles, and occlusions.
- **Player tracking:** Identifying and following players throughout a game despite occlusions.
- **Player re-identification:** Recognizing players even when they briefly leave the frame.
- **Camera calibration:** Aligning camera perspectives to measure player movement and positioning accurately.

If you're passionate about football and AI, feel free to jump in and contribute!
